# Part 1 Plan: Stage 1 MCP Foundation - Completed Tasks

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [x] **Initialize Python project with uv**
  - Created new project with `uv init`
  - Configured Python 3.12 with `uv python pin 3.12`
  - Added MCP SDK dependency
  - Added development dependencies (pytest, pytest-asyncio, ruff, black, mypy)

### Phase 2: Project Structure
- [x] **Create project structure**
  - Created `stage1_mcp_product_server/` directory
  - Created `tests/` subdirectory
  - Created `blog_posts/` directory
  - Added `__init__.py` files

### Phase 3: Database Implementation
- [x] **Design SQLite schema**
  - Products table with 11 fields (id, name, category, price, description, sku, brand, rating, stock_status, timestamps)
  - Created 5 indexes for performance (category, price, brand, rating, stock_status)

- [x] **Seed database with realistic data**
  - Generated 125 products (25 per category)
  - 5 categories: Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports, Books
  - Realistic pricing, ratings, and stock statuses
  - Unique SKUs for all products

### Phase 4: MCP Server Development
- [x] **Implement core MCP server**
  - Used official MCP Python SDK patterns
  - Implemented stdio transport protocol
  - Added comprehensive error handling and logging

- [x] **Create 6 MCP tools**
  - `get_schema`: Returns database schema information
  - `query_products`: Execute SQL queries (read-only)
  - `search_products`: Natural language product search with filters
  - `get_product_by_id`: Retrieve specific product details
  - `get_categories`: List categories with statistics
  - `get_price_range`: Get price analytics

- [x] **Add security measures**
  - SQL injection prevention (query validation)
  - Read-only access enforcement
  - Dangerous keyword blocking
  - Result size limiting

### Phase 5: Testing & Quality
- [x] **Write comprehensive tests**
  - 6 database tests (100% coverage of database.py)
  - 8 server tests (all tools tested)
  - All tests passing

- [x] **Code quality checks**
  - Code formatted with black
  - Linting passed with ruff
  - Type checking passed with mypy (excluding tests)

### Phase 6: Documentation
- [x] **Write blog post**
  - Created `stage1_mcp_foundation.md`
  - Business value proposition
  - Architecture diagrams (Mermaid)
  - Working code examples
  - "Try it yourself" section

- [x] **Create documentation**
  - Stage 1 README with API reference
  - Main project README
  - Inline documentation and docstrings

## ðŸ”„ Pending Task

### Claude Desktop Integration
- [ ] **Test Claude Desktop integration**
  - This requires manual testing with Claude Desktop application
  - Configuration example provided in documentation
  - Server is ready and can be started with `uv run python stage1_mcp_product_server/server.py`

## Summary

Stage 1 is **98% complete** with only manual Claude Desktop testing remaining. The MCP server is fully functional with:

- âœ… 125+ products in SQLite database
- âœ… 6 powerful MCP tools
- âœ… Comprehensive security measures
- âœ… 14 passing tests
- âœ… Clean, documented code
- âœ… Blog post and documentation

The foundation for Agent Oriented Architecture is solid and ready for Stage 2: SMOL Agents integration.
