### Stage 3: Agent Discovery - A2A Protocol
**Goal**: Enable agents to discover and collaborate through Agent Cards

#### Technical Implementation
1. **Multi-Domain Setup**
   - Keep existing inventory database and MCP server
   - Keep existing sales/returns database and MCP server
   - Adapt existing InventoryAgent and SalesAnalyticsAgent (remove ACP decorators)

2. **A2A Implementation**
   - Generate Agent Cards for all three agents (Product, Inventory, Sales)
   - Implement A2A protocol endpoints for each agent
   - Enable direct agent-to-agent communication
   - Demonstrate capability discovery and negotiation

3. **Blog Content**
   - Introduction to A2A protocol
   - Agent Cards as intelligent business cards
   - Direct agent communication patterns
   - Comparison to UDDI: lessons learned

**Deliverables**:
- `stage3_a2a_discovery.md`
- `inventory_mcp/`, `sales_mcp/` directories (existing)
- `agent_cards/` with cards for all three agents
- A2A protocol implementation for each agent

### Stage 4: Agent Registry - AOA Foundation
**Goal**: Introduce dynamic agent discovery and the AOA vision

#### Technical Implementation
1. **Agent Registry Service**
   - Create centralized registry for agent discovery
   - Implement agent registration endpoints
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Health checking and availability monitoring

2. **CRM Integration**
   - Customer database (profiles, support tickets, loyalty status)
   - CRM MCP server
   - CustomerInsightsAgent with A2A capabilities

3. **Orchestrator Introduction**
   - Basic orchestrator that discovers agents via registry
   - Dynamic capability matching
   - Multi-agent query planning

4. **Blog Content**
   - From static to dynamic agent discovery
   - Registry architecture and implementation
   - Introduction to Agent Oriented Architecture
   - Orchestration patterns

**Deliverables**:
- `stage4_aoa_foundation.md`
- `agent_registry/` with registry service
- `crm_mcp/`, `customer_agent/` directories
- `orchestrator/` with basic implementation

### Stage 5: Agent Oriented Architecture - The Complete System
**Goal**: Showcase emergent capabilities through dynamic agent discovery

#### Technical Implementation
1. **Advanced Orchestrator**
   - Enhanced orchestrator with sophisticated planning
   - Dynamic capability discovery
   - Query optimization across domains
   - Result synthesis and formatting

2. **Specialized Agents**
   - ReportingAgent: Generate formatted reports
   - VisualizationAgent: Create charts/dashboards
   - PredictiveAnalyticsAgent: ML-based insights
   - These agents auto-register and are discovered dynamically

3. **Cross-Domain Analytics**
   - "Which products have high return rates from VIP customers?"
   - "Predict inventory needs based on sales trends and customer segments"
   - "Identify product categories with supply chain risks"
   - "Generate executive dashboard for Q4 performance"

4. **Blog Content**
   - AOA as evolution of SOA
   - Emergent workflows demonstration
   - Scaling considerations
   - Future directions

**Deliverables**:
- `stage5_aoa_complete.md`
- `aoa_orchestrator/` directory (enhanced)
- `specialized_agents/` directory
- Complete system demonstration

## Implementation Timeline & Dependencies

### Prerequisites
1. Set up Context7 MCP server for Claude Code
2. Create Python 3.12 virtual environment
3. Install base dependencies: smolagents, MCP SDK, sqlite3

### Stage Progression
Each stage builds on the previous:
- Stage 1: Foundation (MCP + SQLite)
- Stage 2: +SMOL agents
- Stage 3: +ACP coordination
- Stage 4: +A2A discovery
- Stage 5: =AOA complete system

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each MCP server
- Integration tests for agent capabilities
- End-to-end tests for cross-agent queries
- Performance benchmarks for scaling

## Key Design Principles

### Code Quality (via Context7)
- Consistent error handling
- Comprehensive logging
- Type hints throughout
- Docstrings for all public methods
- Security best practices

### Blog Writing Guidelines
- Start with business value
- Show working code snippets
- Include mermaid diagrams
- Provide "try it yourself" sections
- End with "what's next" teasers

### Demonstration Scenarios
Each stage includes realistic business scenarios:
1. Product search and recommendation
2. Inventory optimization
3. Sales trend analysis
4. Customer behavior insights
5. Executive decision support
