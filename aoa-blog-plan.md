### Stage 3: Multi-Domain Intelligence - ACP Integration
**Goal**: Coordinate multiple agents across inventory and sales domains

#### Technical Implementation
1. **New Data Sources**
   - Inventory database (stock levels, warehouse locations, reorder points)
   - Sales/Returns database (transactions, return reasons, timestamps)
   - Create MCP servers for each

2. **New SMOL Agents**
   - InventoryAgent: Stock management and predictions
   - SalesAnalyticsAgent: Sales patterns and return analysis

3. **ACP Integration**
   - Decorate agents with ACP SDK
   - Implement cross-agent communication
   - Query routing and result aggregation

4. **Blog Content**
   - The need for agent coordination
   - ACP architecture patterns
   - Cross-domain query examples
   - Performance considerations

**Deliverables**:
- `stage3_acp_coordination.md`
- `inventory_mcp/`, `sales_mcp/` directories
- `acp_integration/` with decorated agents
- Multi-agent query examples

### Stage 4: Agent Discovery - A2A Protocol
**Goal**: Enable dynamic agent discovery and collaboration

#### Technical Implementation
1. **CRM Integration**
   - Customer database (profiles, support tickets, loyalty status)
   - CRM MCP server
   - CustomerInsightsAgent

2. **A2A Implementation**
   - Generate Agent Cards for all existing agents
   - Implement agent registry
   - Discovery mechanisms
   - Dynamic capability negotiation

3. **Blog Content**
   - A2A vs UDDI: Learning from history
   - Agent Cards as intelligent business cards
   - Discovery patterns and best practices
   - Security considerations

**Deliverables**:
- `stage4_a2a_discovery.md`
- `crm_mcp/`, `customer_agent/` directories
- `a2a_registry/` with agent cards
- Discovery demonstration code

### Stage 5: Agent Oriented Architecture - The Complete System
**Goal**: Showcase emergent capabilities through dynamic agent discovery

#### Technical Implementation
1. **AOA Orchestrator**
   - Master orchestrator agent
   - Dynamic capability discovery
   - Query planning across domains
   - Result synthesis

2. **Specialized Agents**
   - ReportingAgent: Generate formatted reports
   - VisualizationAgent: Create charts/dashboards
   - PredictiveAnalyticsAgent: ML-based insights
   - These agents auto-register and are discovered dynamically

3. **Cross-Domain Analytics**
   - "Which products have high return rates from VIP customers?"
   - "Predict inventory needs based on sales trends and customer segments"
   - "Identify product categories with supply chain risks"
   - "Generate executive dashboard for Q4 performance"

4. **Blog Content**
   - AOA as evolution of SOA
   - Emergent workflows demonstration
   - Scaling considerations
   - Future directions

**Deliverables**:
- `stage5_aoa_complete.md`
- `aoa_orchestrator/` directory
- `specialized_agents/` directory
- Complete system demonstration

## Implementation Timeline & Dependencies

### Prerequisites
1. Set up Context7 MCP server for Claude Code
2. Create Python 3.12 virtual environment
3. Install base dependencies: smolagents, MCP SDK, sqlite3

### Stage Progression
Each stage builds on the previous:
- Stage 1: Foundation (MCP + SQLite)
- Stage 2: +SMOL agents
- Stage 3: +ACP coordination
- Stage 4: +A2A discovery
- Stage 5: =AOA complete system

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each MCP server
- Integration tests for agent capabilities
- End-to-end tests for cross-agent queries
- Performance benchmarks for scaling

## Key Design Principles

### Code Quality (via Context7)
- Consistent error handling
- Comprehensive logging
- Type hints throughout
- Docstrings for all public methods
- Security best practices

### Blog Writing Guidelines
- Start with business value
- Show working code snippets
- Include mermaid diagrams
- Provide "try it yourself" sections
- End with "what's next" teasers

### Demonstration Scenarios
Each stage includes realistic business scenarios:
1. Product search and recommendation
2. Inventory optimization
3. Sales trend analysis
4. Customer behavior insights
5. Executive decision support
